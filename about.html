					<p>I create across photography, graphic design, ink drawing, and screen printing—each medium bringing out a different side of how I see and feel. My style and sense of composition are always shifting. My photography and drawings reflect the people I know and the places that matter to me. They often carry the weight of fleeting emotions or scattered thoughts, turning internal moments into visual ones.</p>
					
					<p>
					In contrast, my design work is guided more by intention—shaped by the message of the piece or the direction of a client. My creative process is experimental: I like to play with ideas as I go, layering and refining until something clicks. I work digitally with Adobe software like Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign to create layouts, posters, logos, and illustrations. On paper, I mix mechanical pencils, pens, and paint markers for smaller, hands-on pieces. Since 2024, I’ve also been screen printing merchandise for local bands, a practice that’s pushed me to explore form, repetition, and texture in new ways.

					<p>Frederico Andrade is a Bay Area-based graphic designer and visual artist whose work draws from a blend of cultural roots and personal history. Born into a Brazilian family and raised in San Francisco, he developed a fascination with visual storytelling at an early age—sketching expressive portraits by age three and later studying at Artworks Fine Art Studio and the Art School of SF Bay, where he honed his understanding of anatomy, color theory, and classical technique.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					In high school, Frederico explored typography and logo design, often sketching brand concepts for friends. He later fell in love with ceramics while studying the fundamentals of form. During the pandemic, he returned to independent study, creating miniature ink drawings of everyday scenes, internet imagery, and current events that sharpened his observational skills and attention to detail.
					</p>
					
					<p>Now pursuing an Associate Degree in Graphic Design at the College of San Mateo (expected 2025), Frederico continues to refine his creative voice through both personal and professional work. His first public piece—a detailed illustration of a Costa’s Hummingbird perched on lavender—was featured in the Flora & Fauna exhibition at San Mateo’s Central Park in 2022. Since the summer of 2024, he has also been screen printing merchandise for local Bay Area bands and is looking to expand his print studio into a broader creative practice. Outside of design, he works as a swim instructor and enjoys surfing and experimenting with fashion as forms of self-expression.
